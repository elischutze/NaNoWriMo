## Nicky (Napier)

- The naive intern
- A young man, a boy really.
- His world view is a curious combination of youthful naivete and gen x trust of the system.
- Completely at odds with Merida Immers, but secretly crushing on her -- but he would never ever make a move, he's just too nice and respectful.
- Represents the sort of idealist young person who has always existed, who still believes in better future against all indications to the contrary, and can rise above the politics and rage with mild detachment.
- Relation to Wint?
