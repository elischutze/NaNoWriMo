## Wint

- Real Names?
  - William Webster-Winter ("what a ridiculous name")
- Protagonist
- A senior editor at the paper -- though he still dabbles in writing.
- All he really wants is for everything to go back to way it was, but of course, it never will.
- Until one day, he is thrust into the middle of a dangerous power play between a group of digital freedom fighters and the powers upholding the status quo (how very Star Wars)
- Drinks too much

### Focal style

- Literary and writerly references
- Lots of indirect speech
- Non-technical language

### Relationships

#### Romantic

- Been dating, but it's hard to meet people when you're not on Tinder.
- His last relationship was years ago, with EXGF didn't end well. Not pining for her though. Their relationship is hopefully not romantic -- maybe at some point of the story he will get confused and think he's in love with her, but he isn't.
