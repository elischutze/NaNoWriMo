## Merida Immers

- A millenial cynic
- Somewhere between the emo girl character from Parks & Rec and the emo girl from Brooklyn 99
- She has an indistinct ethnicity which allows her to fit into almost any subgroup, but also means she doesn't really belong to any of them
- Hard shell, deep enside has a soft side. Her snark is shallow.
- Key transformation: allowing herself to believe that some things in the world are worth it.
- Suffers from deep anxiety but doesn't share it with anyone.
- A junior reporter for the paper
- Studied in the university, but dropped out, disillusioned by the lack of opportunity and the pretentiousness of her classmates
- Works at the paper because it's a relatively easy job to make money.
- Doesn't see that there are any opportunities for her, resigned to living hand to mouth for the rest of her life -- despite being too smart.
- "The world is completely fucked, and this job lets me vent"

### Relationships

#### Merida -> Nicky

Their world views are completely at odds. Nicky is the only person with a lowlier job than her's, so she uses him to prop herself up by making fun of his naivete.

But maybe, as her shell starts to crack, she finds she has feelings for him...?

Nicky and Merida are a sort of juxtaposed pair of foils. They might have a side quest to support the main storyline?

#### Merida -> Wint

Wint is her boss. She respects him to a degree, especially for the work that he has done in the past, but feels sorry for his antiquated ways and his reduced status.

She tries to be very nice to him, but for some reason she finds herself very awkward in their relationship and always ends up blurting the wrong thing.

A sort of father figure?
