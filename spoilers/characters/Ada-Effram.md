## Adaline Effram (name TBD)

- Not your cliche'd hacker type.
- She's trans?
  - Until we meet her (later in the story), we can have him say things like "she was different from any other woman he had ever loved"
  - This could be why Wint left him -- he couldn't reconcile his love for her with his idenity
  - This also works with his bad dating life
  - The shame he feels for having left her is why the stakes of contacting her are so high, and a driver of his internal conflict
  - She really loved him, and she is hurt by him. The trust is broken and needs repairing -- but when he contacts her she can't help but get in touch against her best judgement
  - Love hasn't been easy for her either. Though she does keep a series of lovers, she doesn't feel a connection with any of them.
  - She's working on an algorithm (crypto) for a new kind of token that doens't depend on miners, and cannot be controlled by the marjoity. It could bring peace and equality to the world, and this is something the power that be obviously can't have.

### Focal style

- Direct, technical language
- Empathetic yet a little bit obtuse
- External representation of emotions, less internal monologue
