## Aron Starr

- Recluse that lives in the middle of nowhere (on a sailing boat?)
- African-American?
- Developed a kind of a distributed communication system that works via local area networks, physical beacons that get destroyed after they have been read, etc.
- Considered the founder of a distributed collective of idealistic hackers who will help our heroes along the way
- Nobody has seen him for years. Finding him is going to be important to the story -- he is the only person who can provide a key piece of support
- They communicate by local area networks, so in order to get Aron a message, we need to meet one of his collaborators

### The Collective

- Distributed, no leadership, their decision making is entirely consensus-based
- The decision making is built into the algorithm
- In order to enlist the Collective for help, our heroes need convince a majority
