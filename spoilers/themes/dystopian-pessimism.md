## Dystopian pessimism

- Believe technology and progress have gone too far and we cannot fix it
- Believe the only sustainable way forward is to return to communion with nature
- Very much mixed with climate change issues
- Exchanging first-world problems for third-world problems -- but there will not be any such distinction in the future -- they call it the **fourth world**.
- For the purposes of these story, we'll focus on the subset of these people who also understand technology and view it as a useful tool when harnessed correctly -- wind/solar energy, medicine, communication tools, computers as data storage and research for the continued human communication process
- Therefore they focus on the post-tech world and try to develop survival tools

### Character: Aron Starr

- Believes people should live in self-sustaining local communities that derive their livelihood from nature
- At the same time, believes that a global community of people is necessary so that we can continue to develop ideas, scientific advancements, enhance our understanding of the universe...
- Does not think the decentralised system is more effective -- understands its tradeoff and shortcomings, however for him **it does not matter how fast we are moving, it matters whether or not we can do it sustainably for a long time, and what is the trajectory**.
- This idea can be explained through a metaphor. Right now the human technological advancement is a rocket that's been shot into space -- we are moving so fast but we have no control over the direction, and at the end the result will be destruction (or something better, tbd)
- Now, if we were to slow down, we would not get there as fast. We'd be able control our direction, and we would be able to continue to do it for such a long time that eventually we could get further than the point of self-destruction allows.
