## Points of view

### Techno-phobic

e.g. Wint

- Do not understand how technology works
- Personally experience negative effects of technology-driven change
- As a result, see change, progress, and technology itself only as risks, and not as opportunity

### Techno-positive

e.g. Zee

- Silicon Valley true believers
- Technology has the power to improve the world
- Blind to risks because of their strong belief

### Techno-exploitative

e.g. Zee's "Investors" (tbd)

- May have once been true believers, but no longer focus on that
- May or may not understand risks involved, in either case linded by ambition and greed
- Primarily interested in personal gain (power, money)

### Dystopian pessimists

- Believe technology and progress have gone too far and we cannot fix it
- Therefore they focus on the post-tech world and try to develop survival tools
- Exchanging first-world problems for third-world problems

### Constructive pessimists (better name?)

e.g. Ada

- Believe technology and progress have gone too far, but we can still fix it
- Worried about democracy, sustainability, human experience etc.
- Don't want to return to the state of nature, "The Grid" is their nature and they are very committed to fixing it.
- Some naively believe we can develop better technology that can out-compete the current market, and the governments, companies etc. will follow
- Others want to destroy the current powers because they are evil and self-serving, and only by wiping the slate clean we can rebuild.

### Solar optimists

- Completel pie-in-the-sky optimists who believe we can develop and use general AI for good, solve energy production, live in harmony etc.
