## TODO

### Chapter 1

- Make Wint sound less like a failed writer in Chapter 1, and more like a good man who's fallen on hard times but still tries his best.

- Make it evident Wint is struggling financially -- care of mother, increasing living costs, stagnating wages.
- It's christmas time soon, wants to go see his mother, but it's hard

### Chapter 2

- Make it explicit Merida is not an assistant
- Make it evident Wint is not a big boss -- reduce his staff size and scope title (Chapter 2)
