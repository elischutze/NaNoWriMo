## TODO

### Chapter 1

- Make Wint sound less like a failed writer in Chapter 1, and more like a good man who's fallen on hard times but still tries his best.

- Make it evident Wint is struggling financially -- care of mother, increasing living costs, stagnating wages.
- It's christmas time soon, wants to go see his mother, but it's hard

### Chapter 2

- Make it explicit Merida is not an assistant but a writer
- Give Merida a proper English accent and describe her ethnicity more
- Make it evident Wint is not a big boss -- reduce his staff size and scope title (Chapter 2)

### Chapter 3

- Make it clear Wint needs to fire either Merida or Nicky

### Chapter 4

- Make Nicky's reaction to first sight of Wint bigger and more realistic
- Add a bit of description to what Bitcoin and cryptos are, but not too much!
- Make Wint's decision to make a call to have a lot bigger stakes
