## The Bug Hunt

- In a remote location, close to nature -- it's very cold
- They reach the safe house.
- There's a third party -- male, maybe Ada's current partner?
- The third party goes out to get firewood
- They do a recap of how they have been hunted
- The only logical explanation is that Wint is bugged
  - The tunnel means it's not a satellte
  - The boat means it's not a drone or a person
  - But the clothes were changed
- They need to perform a sweep -- there are bugs that can be attached to a person in places you'd never know
- He needs to take his clothes off. For the second time in two days.
- He feels self-conscious about his body.
- Now you know how I feel every day of my life, says Ada
- She examines his body, inch by inch. There's something vaguely erotic about being inspected about an ex-lover. He can't put his finger on it.
- The dynamic of her wearing clothes and him not renders him very vulnerable -- maybe he had slight sub tendencies? Maybe that's why he fell for Ada, she is a very powerful woman.
- Underpants too. Not again. Make a joke about removing his pants becoming a theme
  - He no longer wears the pants in the relationship, if he ever did...
  - "I see your sense of humour hasn't improved"
- It's so cold. The third party hasn't come in yet with the firewood. He's got shrinkage.
- "Oh come one, stop being such a baby. I've seen you naked before, I know what you're packing and what you're not. Besides, don't forget, I know how dicks work. I used to have one myself."
- She finds nothing
- He begins pulling on his clothes, oddly aroused and violated.
- "When did you get that scar? It looks fresh".
- "When did you get the message about the bitcoin"
- She examines the wound. It looks like a surgical wound.
- "How did you hit your head?" -- he doesn't remember.
- She asks him to sit down. She gets the medical kit of the safe house.
- She snaps open the stitches with an exacto knife and cuts open the wound, blood runs on his face, down his belly
- She daubs the blood away and using tweezers, tugs on a wire
- It makes his head buzz wildly
- We found the tracker. But it's not he kind of tracker we thought.

### Removal of the bug

- Explain how it works -- it can read his mind, kind of.
- YOU ARE THE BUG
- They need to get to someone who knows how these things work
- She knows the best in business
- Problem is, they can't take him anywhere
- There's anaesthetic in the medical kit. They knock him out
- He wakes up, his head is messed up
- There's Oleg. But we don't know he's Oleg
- Oleg: "I'm sorry, I'm not a surgeon, I don't install these, I just operate them"
- "Can you find who put it in"
- "Yeah, there's not that many of these around. I've only just started to work with this model, whoever is after your friend is seriously connected. I can probably found out something though if I can connect to it."
- He turns on the laptop and starts messing with it.
- He turns around, super serious
- Ada, you know how I love you and I would never do anything to hurt you?
- Ada, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
