## Zee meets Boss

- Zee lands at SFO
- He can't wait to get home. He's going to call up some buddies and get stoned
- He missed the days when he was just getting started, the camaraderie and the excitement
- London skunk is so paranoia-inducing, and smoking alone makes him crazy
- London is such a thrash town
- He can't wait to never have to go there again once the "plan" is complete
- He gets into his town car
- San Francisco weather isn't much better than London

---

- Zee starts with a very high status
- He makes some phone calls puts down some other powerful people, to establish his dominance
- The car takes a wrong turn
- He's all WTF! There's a big bowl of weed waiting for him at home.
- The driver says he's been given instructions to go to the boss's house
- Wint becomes nervous. I guess the bowl will have to wait a little

- Calls a meeting with Zee, "one of your employees has become valuable"
- The boss is hearing chatter about Wint on the wire
- Flip status
- Zee is told to find him, or there will be consequences
- Zee goes to Merida -- Merida is now looking for Wint
- There's some people at Wint's house? Because of the suitcase and keys.
- She needs help. Although she dislikes Nicky, she has no alternative
- Nicky knows the story and fills her in
