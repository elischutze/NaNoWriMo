## Chapter 7

It had been a while since Wint had been to a gentleman's club.

- The seedy feeling of entering, illicit, gave him a thrill even if he wasn't here to gawk at women
- He notes happily the basic function of it hasn't changed
- There were still naked women gyrating
- What had changed was the music. They were playing hip hop. The rapper was mumbling and enunciating poorly. In the background other rappers were making sounds.
- Drip, drip, splash
- He looked at the pretty young thing shaking body to the song
- He wouldn't rate the lyrics very highly
- But the music was pure sex
- He cannot help but being aroused
- He feels slightly uncomfortable at the juxtaposition of one hand being aroused and on the other being here on one of the most serious occasions of his life
- He was after a particular woman
- He couldn't see Ada in a place like this, so Hanna must be another hop on some kind of security operation where he's being bounced around
- But hopefully Hanna would take him to Ada
- He hoped Hanna wasn't one of the strippers, because he didn't know if he could keep his eyes where they belonged if a bare-breasted woman were to appear in front of him
- Booze was on sale
- He hadn't had a drink, and though he wanted one, he decided best stay sober
- The strippers who go from table to table were leaving him alone
- Describe what he thinks he looks like from the outside -- a dirty old man in too young man's clothes

---

- Ada sits at the table
- She looks at him, smiling
- William!
- She is happy to see him?
- How have you been?
- Normally he would reply to a question like this with a "good", but he remembered that being Estonian, Ada didn't do small talk. She genuinely wanted to know.
- He says he's been better
- She says she is so happy to see him
- He thought she'd be angry
- She was at first, but ... wounds heal. She didn't hold a grudge.
- He jumps to the bitcoin thing
- Her expression changes
- You came here for that?
- You didn't even ask me how I am doing
- You don't give a shit, you're such a man
- I am SO disappointed in you, Wint
- The words hurt
- He tried to explain
- Would he have come here if he wasn't for the money?
- No... obviously. Case closed.
- Fucking Bitcoin. The whole thing is ruined by speculators
- Did he not learn anything she told him?
- They had a mission -- explain more about Bitcoin at this point
- Wint gets angry. He has no high horse but he's still a proud man and doesn't like being berated.
- "What are you doing in a place like this, Ada?"
- She could explain very well, but she chooses not to. Instead she says, what's wrong with sex work? Why shouldn't people be allowed to control their fate by using whatever assets they have. Wint can arouse people's intellects, they can arouse people's bodies. Why is one more valuable than other?
- Get the fuck out of here, Wint.
- Commotion erupts at the door

---

- Bunch of Irish guys have come in, they refuse to go through the metal detector
- They've punched out the bouncer and they walk into the room now
- The strippers keep stripping
- Some of the strippers don't realise what's going on, they go talk to the Irish
- Irishman grabs a strippers face, force kisses them, pinches their titty and pushes them aside
- Ada is all like "aww hell naww", and goes to take care of it
- She is a strong powerful woman
- It's not just Wint that should be scared of her, she is legit scary
- She walks to one of the Irish guys, greets them "heeey baby", and punches them in the face. They go out like a light
- She braces for a fight. One of them comes at her with a knife. But with the help of one of the strippers, they fight him off.
- The third irish guy pulls out a gun and starts shooting. One of the strippers is hit.
- Ooooh fuck.
- There's a gunfight. They escape via the back elevator
- The lift takes them to a service tunnel
- They walk for a very long time
- They come up. Wint looks around. They're on an island. It's a old military defense base.
- That's where Ada's group is based.

---

(LATER)

- Eventually they need to move from the base. Maybe they detect a drone.
- Fuck, they've been discovered!
- How could that be? The tunnel means nobody could have followed them in.
- They go to a safe house
- The Bug Hunt happens
