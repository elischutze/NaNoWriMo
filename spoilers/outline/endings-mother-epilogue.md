## The Mother Epilogue

(Possible ending, not set in stone.)

Christmas eve. It's snowing.

Wint goes to his mother's care home. She remembers him this time! It seems like she's getting better. He is disappointed he wasn't able to recover the money to fix things. There is an experimental therapy that could reverse the effects of dementia, but there is no way he can afford it now.

She remembers him as his younger self, the way he used to want to imagine himself now. But he's fine with who he is now, he doesn't need to pretend.

Ada is there too. He introduces her to his mother, the person he could not tell back then. It's a bittersweet resolution, as he's done the right thing, but his mother's not really "with it" and doesn't know. He wonders if he should tell her? Ada thinks no, it's ok. She doesn't need that validation.

Besides, they've only been reunited for a couple of weeks. It's too soon. They are hopeful they can make it work this time.

Wint leaves the women of his life behind and goes to the storage unit at the care home to find pictures. He wants to show Ada what a beautiful woman his mother had been, and pictures of his father.

He rummages through boxes looking for the albums.

And what does he find? The laptop.

He holds it and tries to boot it up, but the battery is gone. He no longer wants to but The Intrepid, though. He wants to start something else, something new - something that actually matters and can help humanity navigate through the turmoil.

Maybe the money is on the laptop. Maybe it isn't. Is it even real? He checked the valuation earlier and it's already corrected to $13,000, wiping off a quarter of his value. Maybe next week it'll all be worthless, or it'll be unfathomably valuable.

But it doesn't matter now, not now, it can wait until tomorrow. He's done running. Tonight is time for people and family.

He goes downstairs and unwraps the dinner an uber driver delivered to them. Chinese food, just like they used to have on Christmas eve way back when -- these are his family's traditions. Maybe his brother has arrived?

He looks at his mother interact with Ada or the brother. He thinks his mother is kind of like a primitive artificial intelligence. She can do relatively complicated things like pretend to remember you, but not really. Also, motor skills are hard, just like for robots.

He doesn't yet understand how all the pieces of the technological revolution fit together, but he's excited that in the future good people like his mother may not need to suffer. Maybe an AI can develop a treatment to reverse dementia, or maybe people's consciousnesses can be transferred to new bodies that aren't breaking down, like the faulty machine that his dear mother inhabits.

His brand new smartphone beeps. Ada had went and bought it for him that morning and set it up with secure communication protocols they can use.

It's Merida.
