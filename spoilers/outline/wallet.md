## The Wallet

_The wallet is a McGuffin that sends the story to motion, and makes a surprising comeback at the end._

- A cryptocurrency wallet
- Should we use bitcoin, or come up with a fictionalised version?
- Does this world happen in our reality or in an alternate one?
- Ours would be more effective for the thematic points, alternate would be more fun to write

### Plot ideas

- Maybe later we find out that Ada had a copy of the wallet all along
- She sold them at the previous peak, lost faith in the community
- Is wint angry? Can he be?
