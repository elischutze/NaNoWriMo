## The Virus

_A potential plotline for the urgent threat our hero must solve._

Ada has written a virus. Well, not written in a traditional sense. Ada has written a self-learning program that spreads like a virus from computer to computer. It's completely undetectable and it can be used to gain access to the infected computers. With this information, anybody could do anything: Steal information, destroy the computers, control elections, etc.)

The virus was targeted to infect the computers of Facebook, Twitter, etc. -- specific companies Ada wants to bring down in service of her vision of a more democratic, sustainable Grid. Her plan was to learn what they were doing so that she could expose the companies for what they are (and potentially wipe out their current data set so everyone can get a fresh start, though she doesn't admit as much)

The problem is that the self-learning virus has figure out a way of breaking out of the data centers where it was supposed to be confined. It wasn't supposed to be possible, she made sure of it, so maybe it's caused by a programming error, or maybe because the virus has become actually self-learning in a way that she didn't intend to and can't really fathom -- though it's _probably_ just a bug...

In any case, the whole world, more or less, is infected. Every computer that's connected to the internet, or gets in contact with another infected computer locally will get infected, apart from those that have been "immunized" by a marker metadata file that makes the virus leave the machine along.

(Of course, if the virus really has learned to do things it wasn't taught to, maybe it can also just choose to ignore this file... But surely that's not the case, right?)

(Or maybe Ada has access to the system, but for some reason the virus is not respecting its self-destruct command... hell of a bug, that one -- if this is the case, she needs to be able to develop a "cure" or immunisation, and there is no marker file to begin with.)

For now the virus is just lying dormant, but once someone can log on and place an activation message to a specific server (or specific blockchain) at a specific time, the virus will spread into action!

Now, of course, different parties has different motivations for being the first one to gain access to the server.

- Ada needs to stop this from happening. Although she hates the current system, the destruction of the entire digital system would cause havoc and death and anarchy, and she doesn't want it -- she wants to be on the grid.
- The dystopian pessimist types want to get access to it, so that they can destroy the entire world's infrastructure so that we can return to a state of nature, and reduce the population size etc.
- The techno-optimists want to just protect the system
- The evil technocrat investors want to protect their investments, but also to gain access to all systems to make a profit and control the world (_pinky in corner of mouth evil_).

### Ada's mission

- She needs to save the entire grid from the bad players
- It's not enough that she can control access, she needs to immunize it to make sure it can never be used, otherwise the world would never be safe
- Ironically, she needs to work together with the techno-optimists she initially set out to expose and destroy, because they now have a shared goal (which we will learn gradually)
- In the middle of all this, Wint barges back into her life.

### Wint's role

Some ideas:

- Wint just gets mixed in and wants to help. Ada brings him onboard because he is no longer safe, and when he's nearby she can keep him safe -- but also, close because she still has feelings for him... (this makes Wint quite passive, and he's more like a foil than a protagonist, which might be boring to read)
- Wint has the perfect access to Zee, which is a total coincidence. This would work, but in order for Ada to want to exploit this, it would require that we already know that Zee is not a bad guy -- and it would be delicious to do a role twist where we think he's a bad guy and then turns out to be a good person in a bad bind. _Could we keep Ada's motivation's hidden until the twist?_
- Wint is the perfect blank person to infiltrate Zee's system. He has access, but because he's never had a smartphone or social networks, he is a total unknown to their algorithms -- an AI helper that tries to predict people's next step and plans, which makes it hard to take out the company.
