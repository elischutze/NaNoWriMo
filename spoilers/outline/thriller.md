## Thriller plotline

Potential plot points and scenes. Needs a lot more directionality, active choices, etc.

In every scene, each character must have a clear want.

### Starting point

London, Fall/Winter 2017. Wint is going through his everyday life. He is a newspaper editor, drinks too much, goes on bad dates. Nothing much has happened to him recently.

### Threat

He finds out that the owners of the paper are going to sell to Tronc (equivalent), and he would be out of a job.

Not a lot of opportunities for a writer of his age anymore, especially one who refuses to embrace the modern ways and the moral laxity of their editors. Bills are piling up and he worries what happens if he is out of a work -- he spent his youth travelling and didn't save nearly enough, he thought he was invincible.

All he wants is everything to go like it once was, but he knows it never was all that he wants to believe.

Maybe if he can write one big story he can get a book deal and ride it to retirement?

### Opportunity

Via a cryptic message on his article, he finds out that he might be a millionaire -- in bitcoin. When he was writing a story about it back in 2009, he met Ada as part of the research of the story, and as part of the story he buys some bitcoin. As an attempt to impress her, he buys $1000 worth -- now worth over $200 million.

He doesn't really understand anything about Bitcoin. Merida and Nicky help him understand it, but it's of no use -- he no longer has the computer he used to buy it. It vanished along with Ada along mysterious circumstances.

He needs to find her. Earlier in their relationship, she gave him an emergency contact he could use in case he ever needed to, but only in drastic emergencies. Surely this one counts?

### Contact

The contact is just a dead phone number. Resigned, Wint muses about the loss of what he never had and the purpose of wealth.

But then, she's gets into touch with him (though maybe not in person, so we can delay meeting her?), demanding to know what the emergency is. She's paranoid. They are after him. He should not have made contact, that dead drop has been compromised and now his life is in danger. He must immediately vanish.

She disappears into the aether, leaving him holding the address of a safe house he is never to speak out loud, never to go to with his cell phone, never to enter into any GPS system, etc.

### Close call

Wint doesn't believe her. She was always crazy, and she's clearly gone off her rocker. Wint tries to go on with his life, but mysterious things start to happen. His office is broken into. His landlady reports there were strange men at his house.

Half hoping Ada still has his wallet, he takes the necessary precautions (fly to Norway, cross the border, etc...?) and goes to the safe house.

### Safe house (in Helsinki)

He gets there and meets a cast and crew of characters living off the grid. They have computers, but none of them are connected to the internet. When they need internet connections, they go wardriving or to public networks -- none of which can be trusted.

Ada has not been seen since he met Wint, and it's all Wint's fault. We hear about the importance of Ada to the movement.

Wint needs to work together with the Safe house residents to find her, and perhaps, save her.

### (Somewhere in the plot) Merida & Nicky Interlude #1

Merida and Nicky are worried about Wint. He hasn't come in for a couple of days, and Nicky thinks he's maybe been fired. Merida thinks he found his bitcoin wallet and he's somewhere on a beach right now? With trepidation, they go to see Zee to ask him.

Zee is uncharacteristically distraught. Something's clearly wrong -- his company's board of directors wants to replace him? He is indebted to them. They're Real Shady People.

Ominously, Zee tells Merida and Nicky they need to find Wint, or they're all going to be out of a job.

### (Somewhere in the plot) Medida & Nicky Interlude #2

They uncover the secret of the paper -- they've been spreading subliminal propaganda all along.

Merida's shell starts to break. She thinks of Wint, who is in grave danger trying to save the paper that's actually the bad guys.

Nicky tries to keep up appearances, but he's moving towards the opposite direction: he's starting to lose he naivete.

We find that as both of these characters' Belief character sliders move closer to the center, they start to relate to each other more.

### Zee's interlude

Zee finds Wint (and Ada).

Turns out Zee is actually not a bad guy after all, just a kid way in over his head in a deadly game. None of his money is actually his own, and he thinks, maybe Wint's wealth can help him buy the paper outright so that he can get out and turn it around?

(Has Wint been working for the evil corp all along? When he finds out, his mission flips -- instead of saving the paper, they must save Ada and destroy the paper's investors to free him.

### Things that must happen

- Things must get really, really bad
  - Someone gets killed and it's Wint's fault
  -

### Some ideas of endings

- The bitcoin is gone. It's on the ledger, but nobody has access to it. Wint comes to term with this. Money won't make anyone happy, but happy human relationships will. Maybe the real wealth was the friends we made along the way.

  - Additional twist: Or maybe the bitcoin is there after all? Wint receives a gift that turns out to be very, very, very valuable. (Maybe an object we have foreshadowed earlier.) He looks at it, and puts it away, deciding not to sell it.

- They get the money but must use it to buy the safety of one of the characters.
