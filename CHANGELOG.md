### November 3: Gentler introduction to Wint.

Based on [feedback](https://github.com/jevakallio/NaNoWriMo/issues/1), I improved the way we introduce Wint in the early chapters. The following are either changes or clarifications, depending on whether you believe that is how I always intended him to be :)

- Improve Wint's physical characterisation. He hopefully comes off slightly less physically repellent now.
- Fix Wint's emotional characterization in the beginning by describing his past, his challenges at work, romantic failures, and the financial struggles heightened by the illness of his mother (more about this later)
- Clarify that Wint is not a big shot editor. We've reduced his staff size to a dozen, and made it clear Merida is not his assistant
- Made Wint's mother American to explain Wint's somewhat inconsistent word choices :)
