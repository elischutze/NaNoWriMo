## FAQ

### When can I read it?

You can read my daily chapters starting November 1st. I'll try to write most days, finishing at over 50,000 words on November 30th as per the rules of [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org).

### Is it going to be any good?

Probably not. At least not in the traditional sense of "good". Most novels you read in your lifetime have been written by better writers than me, over a much longer period of time, and they have gone through test readings, edits, revisions, etc.

Mine will be a rough first draft written over 30 days. So odds are, it's not going to be amazing.

### Why should I read it?

I didn't say that you should.

### Then why are you writing it in the open?

I think it's an interesting experiment, and I want to see what comes out of it. I'm particularly curious how a theoretical audience will affect the quality of my first draft. I have completed NaNoWriMo before, but I never did anything with my manuscripts, because they were so rough they would have required a total rewrite. I'm hoping that, whether or not anyone reads my daily chapters, having to put my work out there will motivate me to plan, outline and refine more as I go.

### How can I contribute?

You can open issues and pull requests -- though I won't guarantee they will be accepted.

### Why use GitHub?

Why not!
